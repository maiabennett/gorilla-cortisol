1. Get raw reads sequnces (fastq): reference files can be found in the [Raw Reads folder](https://swan-ood.unl.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs//common/claytonlab/maibennett/gorilla_cortisol/raw_reads)
    - Create a directory for this analysis with a project-specific title (e.g., 'gorilla_cortisol'). 
    - Copy linked raw_reads folder or reference current location in HCC (claytonlab/maibennett/gorilla_cortisol/raw_reads)
        * The sequence files are named following the schema 'sampleIDMapping_S###_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz', where sampleIDMapping is a column in metadata.txt which allows mapping of cortisol metadata to microbiome data
    - Copy the first column of metadata.tsv (excluding the column name) into a file named 'acc_list.txt'; each line should have one accession number

2. Pre-process the data using FastQC and MultiQC: reference files can be found in the [Pre-process folder](https://github.com/clayton-lab/BugSeq-er/tree/main/Pre-process)
    - Create project subdirectory 'qc' within the project directory, then create a subdirectory of 'qc' named 'script_output'
    - Copy get_sample_name_dic.sh to the project directory
    - Run 'bash get_sample_name_dic.sh > sample_dic.txt' in the project directory to retrieve the sample list where each accession number is space-delimited 
    - Copy qc.slurm to the project directory
        * Copy the contents of sample_dic.txt to qc.slurm for the 'sample_name' variable 
        * Edit the paths in qc.slurm lines 8 & 9 (.../qc/script_output), 20 (.../raw_reads), and 28 & 29 (.../qc)
    - Run 'sbatch qc.slurm' in the project directory

3. Run Qiime2: reference files can be found in the [qiime2 folder](https://github.com/clayton-lab/BugSeq-er/tree/main/qiime2)
    - Copy 'manifest_builder.py' to the project directory 
    - Bulid the manifest file by running 'python manifest_builder.py -i (acc list filename) -p (path to the raw reads)'
    - Create project subdirectory 'qiime2' within the project directory, then create a subdirectory of 'qc' named 'script_output'
    - Install QIIME2 by running 'module load qiime2/[(most recent package)](https://hcc.unl.edu/docs/applications/modules/available_software_for_crane/)'
        * All HCC module names and versions can be found [in the HCC documentation](https://hcc.unl.edu/docs/applications/modules/available_software_for_crane/)
    - Download the latest release for the reference SILVA classifier to your local computer [here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/data-resources/#taxonomy-classifiers-for-use-with-q2-feature-classifier)
        * To download, select the "Silva 138 99% OTUs full-length sequences" under the "Naive Bayes classifiers trained on:" section 
        * NOTE: qiime2/2021.2 is the most recent version compatible with the SILVA classifier, and use of these packages will cause part2.slurm to fail: either,
            - Ensure part2.slurm line 28 reads as 'module load qiime2/2021.2' (in which case, qiime2 results may be outdated), or
            - Use RESCRIPt to train the classifier as instructed [here](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/processing-filtering-and-evaluating-the-silva-database-and-other-reference-sequence-data-with-rescript/15494) for compatibility with newer qiime2 packages
    - Upload the reference SILVA database file to the qiime2 subdirectory
    - Copy metadata.tsv and the manifest file to the qiime2 subdirectory
        * Ensure metadata.tsv in the right format [(example provided here)](https://github.com/clayton-lab/BugSeq-er/blob/main/sample_metadata.tsv): specifically, the second row should read "#q2:types", then "categorical" for all other columns
    - Copy 'part1.slurm' to the project directory 
        * Edit the path in lines 8 & 9 (.../qiime2/script_output) and 20 (.../qiime2)
        * If the data contain adapter sequnces, edit line 37 & 38 to match the sequence
        * If the data doesn't contain adapter sequnces, comment out lines 35-44
    - Run 'sbatch part1.slurm' in the project directory
    - Copy 'part2.slurm' to the project directory

           - Access the 'Interactive Quality Plot' tab
           - Assign trimming values for forward (line 18, p_trim_left_f) and reverse (line 19, p_trim_left_r) reads by estimating the lowest sequence base (x axis) with quality data in the relevant graph 
           - Assign truncating values for forward (line 20, p_trunc_len_f) and reverse (line 21, p_trunc_len_r) reads by estimating the highest sequence base (x axis) with quality data in the relevant graph
        * If no adapter sequnces were removed, replace part2.slurm line 33 with '--i-demultiplexed-seqs artifacts/demuxed-paired-end.qza'
        * Edit line 72 (--i-classifier) to match the name of the reference SILVA database file
    - Run 'sbatch part2.slurm' in the project directory

        * Edit the path in lines 8 & 9 (.../qiime2/script_output) and 15 (.../qiime2)
        * Visualize 'table-viz.qzv', located in the 'qiime2' 'artifacts' subdirectory, by downloading to your computer and uploading the file to [Qiime2 View](https://view.qiime2.org/) 
            - Access the 'Interactive Sample Detail' tab
            - Assign sampling depth value (line 29, p_sampling_depth) as the smallest 'Feature Count' value
        * Ensure that there is not a subdirectory names 'core-metrics-results' (if you have previous runs)
    - Run 'sbatch part3.slurm'
    - Copy 'normalized_srs.sh' to the qiime2 subdirectory to perform normalization using SRS (scaling with ranked subsampling)
        * Visualize 'table.qza', located in the 'qiime2/artifacts' subdirectory, by downloading to your computer and uploading the file to the [SRS Shiny app](https://vitorheidrich.shinyapps.io/srsshinyapp/)
        * Select a sampling depth (Cmin) at the highest value which doesn’t result in eliminating samples
        * Assign Cmin value (line 7, --p-c-min)
    - Run 'bash normalized_srs.sh' in the 'qiime2' subdirectory

4. Create relative abundance plots (heatmap and barplot): relevant files can be found in the [R folder](https://github.com/clayton-lab/BugSeq-er/tree/main/R)
